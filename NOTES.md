It's interesting to note that this implies that the mean of random numbers zigzags narrowly around 0 (somewhat approaches 0), but the sum of those numbers zigzags widely around 0.  

This is because the calculation for the mean includes a division by the amount of numbers which always grows,  
while the calculation for the sum may vary widely between iterations. 


Think of randomly generating text from the alphabet "-+0123456789" and evaluating it as a mathematical expression.
