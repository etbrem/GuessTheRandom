It's interesting to note that this implies that the mean of random numbers zigzags narrowly around 0 (approaches 0), but the sum of those numbers zigzags widely around 0 and only ever reaches 0 when the mean does.  

This is because the calculation for the mean includes a division by the amount of numbers which always grows,  
while the calculation for the sum may vary widely between iterations.

Think of randomly generating text from the alphabet "-+0123456789" and evaluating it as a mathematical expression.
