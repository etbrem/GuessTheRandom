Does this work as long as the hint is a linear function?

Any given turn gives us little to no information but the collection of turns gives us almost complete information.

It's interesting to note that this implies that the mean of random numbers zigzags narrowly around 0 (somewhat approaches 0), but the sum of those numbers zigzags widely around 0.   
This is because the calculation for the mean includes a division by the amount of numbers which always grows,  
while the calculation for the sum may vary widely between iterations.  

The limit can be said to be behavioural/statistical rather than being mathematically assured, since we can't assert that we'll be done by any given turn.  


Think of randomly generating text from the alphabet "-+0123456789" and evaluating it as a mathematical expression.
